    <p>A Software Reconnaissance Engineer is someone who is constantly exploring and learning about software and how it interacts with the world. My specific interest is in improving the ways people communicate using technology. In more words, I like to say that I am a full-stack web developer that enjoys experimenting with new things to help find interesting intersections in technology to help design beautiful and powerful ways for people to share knowledge, advice and experiences.</p>

    <p>Outside of the tech-world I am an Eagle Scout. I enjoy contributing to open source projects, reading, listening to music and wandering through cities and countrysides.</p>
