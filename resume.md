## Background

I am a Software Reconnaissance Engineer. Think of me as a full-stack developer with an interest in improving the ways people communicate using technology. I enjoy experimenting with new things to help find interesting intersections in technology to help design beautiful and powerful ways for people to share knowledge, advice and experiences.

I am an Eagle Scout. In my free time I enjoy contributing to open source projects, reading, listening to music and wandering through cities and countrysides.

## Education

Computer Science, B.S.
Fall 2006 - Spring 2011
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

## Proficiency

I have been writing code, running servers and experimenting with new software since 2002. Most recently the majority of code I have written has been in Javascript, Ruby, Python and Go, but I have experience in PHP, Java, Bash, C, SML/NJ, SQL and F#.
